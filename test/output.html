        <h1>Hello “world”…</h1>
        <p>The three wise monkeys […] sometimes called the three mystic
        apes—are a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial
        principle to (“see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil”). The
        three monkeys are Mizaru (🙈), covering his eyes, who
        sees no evil; Kikazaru (🙉), covering his ears, who
        hears no evil; and Iwazaru (🙊), covering his mouth,
        who speaks no evil.</p>
