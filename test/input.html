        <h1>Hello "world"...</h1>
        <p>The three wise monkeys [. . .] sometimes called the three mystic
        apes--are a pictorial maxim. Together they embody the proverbial
        principle to ("see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"). The
        three monkeys are Mizaru (:see_no_evil:), covering his eyes, who
        sees no evil; Kikazaru (:hear_no_evil:), covering his ears, who
        hears no evil; and Iwazaru (:speak_no_evil:), covering his mouth,
        who speaks no evil.</p>
